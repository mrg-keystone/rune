# Examples

Runnable examples for `@mrg-keystone/keep`.

## In-process client (`in-process-client/`)

Shows the `backend` client returned by `bootstrapServer` — an in-process HTTP client whose
`fetch` is a drop-in for the global `fetch`, but which dispatches against the **exact** server
pipeline (controllers, guards, pipes, interceptors, exception filters, middleware) **without
binding a port or touching the network**.

### Run it

```bash
deno task example
# or
deno run -A examples/in-process-client/main.ts
```

Expected output:

```
GET /users        → 200 [ { id: 1, name: "Alice" } ]
POST /users       → 200 { id: 2, name: "Bob" }
GET /users/2      → 200 { id: 2, name: "Bob" }
GET /users/999    → 404 {"status":404,"description":"Not found","name":"NotFoundException","message":"404 - Not found"}
```

(Each request also prints `[ingress …]` / `[egress …]` log lines — that's the logging
middleware running in the pipeline, in-process.)

### The files

| File | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `users.ts` | An ordinary Danet `@Controller` + `@Module` — a tiny in-memory Users API. Nothing here is special to the in-process client. |
| `server.ts` | `export const app = await bootstrapServer(...)`. Bootstrap **once**, export the app. `bootstrapServer` only *initializes* (it does **not** `listen()`), so `app.backend` is usable immediately, from any importer. |
| `main.ts` | The demo: `app.backend.fetch(...)` for a relative GET, a POST with a JSON body, a path param, and a real 404. |

### What to notice

- **No `listen()`.** No port is ever bound. `backend.fetch` calls the pipeline directly.
- **No token.** In-process calls are trusted automatically (a process-private key is stamped on
  each request and verified internally; it never leaves the process). The *same* requests over
  the network would each need an access token.
- **It's a true `fetch`.** Relative paths resolve, `RequestInit` works, a `Request` object works,
  and you get back a raw `Response`. Swap `fetch` → `backend.fetch` and existing client code keeps
  working — in-process.

This is the pattern for calling your own API from server-side code (SSR routes, background jobs,
scripts, tests) without going out to the network or managing tokens.

> **Note on imports.** The example code imports the published package names
> (`@mrg-keystone/keep`, `@danet/core`, `reflect-metadata`) so it reads exactly like a real
> consumer's code. Inside this repo those names are aliased to the local source via the import map
> in `deno.json`. In your own project, add `@mrg-keystone/keep` from JSR and import the same way.

> **Security.** `backend.fetch` is a *trusted* channel — anything dispatched through it skips auth.
> Never pipe inbound network requests through it. To expose the API over the network, mount
> `app.handler` (which strips the in-process trust header). See the main README's
> "Security: the in-process bypass and how to mount safely".
