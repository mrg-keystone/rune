// `rune -v` (aliases: --version, -V, version) — report this build's version and
// check whether a newer rune has been released.
//
// rune ships as a ROLLING `latest` GitHub release (the binary carries no semver
// tag of its own), so "am I stale?" can't be answered by comparing semvers — a
// keep-only auto-bump would false-nag. The honest signal is the COMMIT: the
// binary bakes the commit it was built from (RUNE_COMMIT, see gen-version.ts).
//
// Crucially, the comparison target is NOT the git `latest` tag: gh-release
// freezes that tag (and the release's published_at) and only swaps the ASSETS
// in place, so the tag ref lags the served binary by weeks. Instead the CI run
// that builds the binaries also uploads its commit as a sibling release asset,
// `commit.txt`. Reading that asset compares the running binary against the
// commit of the binary you'd actually download — same release, no lag, and (as
// a plain asset download, like install.sh) not subject to the API rate limit.
