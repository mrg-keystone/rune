// Artifact-driven lint configuration (WO-4d / D3).
//
// The engine's 23 rules (mod-root.ts) carry the rule LOGIC; the artifact's
// type-keyed `lint` array carries the POLICY (enabled / severity / message).
// This module is the single place the two are reconciled: RULE_TYPE_MAP links
// each engine rule name to its artifact lint `type`, and resolveSettings ->
// annotateAndFilter apply the artifact's policy over rule results — so editing
// a rule's severity/enabled in the artifact changes a real `rune .`
// run with no rule-code change (L6). Rules with no artifact entry stay on
// (severity error) — their logic is unchanged, so their tests and the default
// lint output are byte-identical (L4 holds on the default path).
//
// "No rule logic in two places": the check() bodies live only in the rule
// modules; this layer is pure policy. The studio shares it in WO-5.
