// ENRICHED before a module ships — its scaffold `todo: true` flag replaced with a
// real suggestion + `why`. rune sync nudges about this on every run (the always-on
// signal); this rule is the enforcement teeth.
//
// Strict-gated on purpose. A fresh scaffold mid-work must not block iteration, so
// the rule stays SILENT in a plain `rune lint`. Under strict — `rune lint --strict`,
// or `RUNE_LINT_STRICT`/`RUNE_STRICT` in the env (the CI profile) — it fires as a
// normal (failing) violation, so a project can refuse to ship un-enriched rules.
// (The engine's lint CLI treats every violation as an error and exits 1; gating on
// strict is how we get "warning by default, error under strict" without flipping
// the exit semantics of every other rule.)

// The keep cake artifact name; matched dir-agnostically so a KEEP_FIXTURES_DIR
// override (the file need not live in `fixtures/`) is still covered.

A generated spec/misc/heal-rules.json drives keep's cake self-heal panel: when an endpoint fails, its fault slug is looked up here and the suggestions become one-click fixes. rune scaffolds one entry per slug with a placeholder marked \`todo: true\`. An un-enriched entry shows the user a TODO label instead of a real fix.

Enrichment means answering, for each slug: what state makes this slug fire, and what is the cheapest path out? Prefer, in order: run-step (a concrete or regex endpoint that repairs the state) -> pick/set-input (a value already present in captures) -> retry (transient causes only, with the reason in \`why\`) -> note (pure guidance, e.g. an env var to set; add retryAfter when a retry helps after the human acts). Never propose a destructive endpoint as a run-step. The \`why\` is shown verbatim to the user, so write it as the one-line explanation of the fix. Then remove the \`todo: true\` flag.`;

${violations.join("\n")}

Enrich each listed slug in ${path}: replace the TODO suggestion with a concrete
fix (run-step/set-input/pick/retry/note) and a real \`why\`, then delete the
\`todo: true\` flag. A module is not done while todo:true entries remain.`;
