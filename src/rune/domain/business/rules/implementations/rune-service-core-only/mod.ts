[SRV] declarations are shared infrastructure. They live in exactly one spec —

have a single source of truth. Every other module spec references those services
by prefix (\`service:noun.verb(...)\`) without re-declaring them.

src/core/core.rune and delete the local declaration.`;

core.rune automatically.`;
