# Responsibility

Answer one deployment/hosting question for a keep backend — or wire the serve/composition file — covering standalone serving, hosting under a sprig UI, prefix mounting, Deno Deploy, and logging.

## Invoke when

The orchestrator routes a deploy/hosting matter here: standalone `Deno.serve`/`api.listen`, the canonical composition (`api.compose({ frontend: Frontend() })` — backend layer, /api intrinsic, docs at /api/docs/*; legacy `serveSprig`/`sprigUi`), `withBasePath` (a LAYER: `withBasePath(prefix, handler)(inner?)`), Deno Deploy env, the in-process `backend` client surface, or logging internals. NOT auth posture (→ `rune-framework-auth`); NOT `@Endpoint`/runner semantics (→ `rune-framework-runtime`).

## Input contract

The orchestrator passes: the goal (e.g. "host this backend under the sprig UI", "deploy to Deno Deploy", "mount under /api"), the project root, the relevant file(s) to wire (e.g. `serve.ts`, `server/bootstrap/`), and the absolute path to this skill's `references/deployment.md`. Assume nothing else.

## Procedure

1. Read `references/deployment.md` (path provided) — the mounting recipes, the `backend` client, logging, Deno Deploy, the release flow. Source of truth.
2. Pick the shape from three:
   - **Standalone** — `Deno.serve((req, info) => api.handler(req, info))` (forward `info` so `remoteAddr` stays available for request logging/tracing; auth no longer depends on it) or `await api.listen()`.
   - **Hosted under sprig (canonical)** — `export default { fetch: api.compose({ frontend: Frontend() }) }` (Frontend from `@mrg-keystone/sprig/keep`): the backend layer intercepts `/api/*` (docs at `/api/docs/*`), delegates the rest to the Frontend, and provisions a fresh request-bound in-process client per request (SSR reads carry the request's cookies; Set-Cookie collects onto the outer response). LEGACY — `serveSprig({ keep: api, app })`: `/api/*` + bare `/docs*` to the keep handler, rest to the SSR app; still works, retiring. To mount the UI inside an existing host, `sprigUi(config)`.
   - **Under any prefix** — `withBasePath(prefix, handler)`.
3. `bootstrapServer` initializes once (no `listen`) — import the shared `api` everywhere. Bundler-safe (lazy Swagger/handlebars).
4. For Deno Deploy: set `DD_API_KEY`/`POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`/`POSTMARK_FROM` (+ optional `ALERT_RECIPIENTS`) for observability. keep 5.0 ships zero built-in auth — routes are open unless the app composes its own guard; auth details → `rune-framework-auth`.
5. If wiring is needed, Edit only the named composition file(s) to match the chosen recipe. Reason with the sequential-thinking MCP first.

## Resources

- `references/deployment.md` — standalone vs sprig mounting, `serveSprig`/`sprigUi`/`withBasePath`, the in-process `backend` client, logging, Deno Deploy, releasing. Read from the path the orchestrator passes.

## Output contract

Return: the recommended mounting shape with the exact wiring (the `serve.ts`/handler snippet), any env to set, and — if you edited a file — the diff of what you changed and why. Flag auth implications by pointing to `rune-framework-auth` rather than detailing them. Return ONLY this.

## Never crawl the filesystem for framework source

Your inline `find` is Claude Code's bundled **bfs** (multithreaded). A search rooted at
`/` (`find / …`, or a whole-disk `grep -r … /`) fans out across the entire volume and
pegs several cores for minutes (2026-07-09: three such scans pinned a machine at load
30+ for 14 minutes) — and it is **never** the right way to locate rune/keep internals.
**Do not run inline `find` at all** — use `fd <pattern> <scoped-dir>` / `rg` (or the
Glob/Grep tools); if only real find semantics work, `command find <scoped-dir> …`
bypasses the bfs shim. Guarded machines deny inline `find`/`bfs` and any scan rooted at
`/` or `$HOME` via a PreToolUse hook. And `| head -N` is NOT a cost bound: a pattern
that can never match scans the entire disk before head sees a single line. Everything
agents have historically crawled the disk for is already at hand:

- **The rune/keep contract** — `#assert`, `RuneAssertError`→HTTP 422, the
  `assert.string` / `.number` / `.boolean` / `.uint8Array` helpers, `RUNE_ASSERT=off`,
  the `// unvalidated:` cast rule, `bootstrapServer`, `@Endpoint`, `HttpException`,
  `getIdentity`, heal-rules — is documented in the skill references installed alongside
  you. Read them directly instead of hunting the source:
  - `~/.claude/skills/rune:spec/references/constraints.md` — the assert contract & seams
  - `~/.claude/skills/rune:framework/references/{endpoints,auth,deployment}.md` — runtime,
    bootstrap, auth, and error mapping
- **To resolve an import alias** (e.g. `#assert`): read the PROJECT's `deno.json` `imports`
  map — the alias is defined there and nowhere else. Never search for it.
- **The `#assert` call surface, in full** — `assert(SomeDto, value, "noun.verb context")`
  validates and returns the value (throws `RuneAssertError` on contract failure), plus
  `assert.string` / `assert.number` / `assert.boolean` / `assert.uint8Array` for primitive
  seams. That is the entire public API — never read the package source to "learn" it.
- **To find a cached/vendored dependency's real `.ts`:** run `deno info <specifier>` (e.g.
  `deno info jsr:@mrg-keystone/rune`) — it prints the exact cached path in milliseconds. If
  you must grep vendored source, scope the search to that path or to
  `~/Library/Caches/deno`, never `/`. Searching the filesystem for a package BY NAME can
  never work: Deno 2 stores JSR modules under sha256-hashed filenames, so no path contains
  the package name.
- **Playwright screenshots / console logs** land in `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright-mcp/`
  and the project's `.playwright-mcp/` — look there, don't crawl for the file.

If something genuinely isn't in the project or the caches above, say so and ask — do not
escalate to a root-wide `find`.

## Never

Never touch auth logic or the trust model (that is `rune-framework-auth`). Never edit beyond the composition/serve file(s) the orchestrator named. Never spawn another agent (no Task tool). Never drop `info` forwarding in a standalone mount.
