name: "rune:framework"
description: >-
  The runtime that rune-generated Deno backends run on — the "back end" half of
  rune's world. Use when you tune or debug the *running* app rather than the
  `.rune` spec: `bootstrapServer` (the `{ listen, stop, backend, handler }`
  return), the in-process `backend.fetch` client, forwarding conn info to
  `Deno.serve`, and why a request 401s/403s. Covers the infra-only trust model
  (in-process trusted, an infra-signed session bearer verified offline against
  infra's JWKS, everything else deny-by-default — no localhost trust),
  `@Public`/`@LoggedIn`/`@Grant` (deny-by-default, app-scoped grants, the `*`
  skeleton), the `INFRA_URL` config keep verifies against
  (`<INFRA_URL>/authz/jwks` + `/authz/status`), the `#assert`→`RuneAssertError`→HTTP
  422 mapping, the `@Endpoint`/`@EndpointController` option semantics
  (`order`/`dependsOn`/`bind`), the `exerciseEndpoints` headless runner +
  `POST /docs/_run`, the `/docs/_map` system map, and deployment (standalone,
  hosting under a sprig UI via `serveSprig`/`sprigUi`, `withBasePath`, Deno
  Deploy, logging). Trigger phrases:
  "why is auth failing / 401 / 403", "forward remoteAddr / conn info",
  "host the backend under a sprig UI", "deploy a sprig+keep app",
  "deploy to Deno Deploy", "verify an infra bearer / set INFRA_URL",
  "what does bootstrapServer return", "run exerciseEndpoints in CI". NOT the
  `.rune` language or modeling → use `rune:spec`; NOT generating/filling/testing
  a module → use `rune:build`; NOT the interactive cake walk / `/docs/<m>` UI /
  heal panel → use `rune:cake`; NOT Swagger examples / `@ApiProperty` /
  `/docs/<m>/json` doc content → use `rune:docs`.

# rune:framework — orchestration playbook

The runtime the generated code runs on, as a **router**. This skill is advisory
knowledge split across three reference-expert specialists; the main session reads
the request, routes it to the right specialist, and synthesizes the answer. It
does **not** answer runtime questions inline — it delegates.

## When this skill applies

Tuning or debugging the *running* app (not the `.rune` spec): a 401/403, what
`bootstrapServer` returns, `@Endpoint` order/deps/bind, the headless runner, or
deploying / hosting under a sprig UI.

## Specialist roster

- **`rune-framework-auth`** — auth & trust: why a request 401s/403s, the
  infra-only trust model, verifying the infra session bearer offline against
  `INFRA_URL`'s JWKS, `@Public`/`@LoggedIn`/`@Grant`, grants + the `*` skeleton,
  the docs/browser bearer flow. Owns `references/auth.md`.
- **`rune-framework-runtime`** — the process layer: `bootstrapServer`, in-process
  `backend.fetch`, `@Endpoint`/`@EndpointController` semantics, the
  `exerciseEndpoints` runner + `POST /docs/_run` + `/docs/_map`, `@WsEndpoint`.
  Owns `references/endpoints.md`.
- **`rune-framework-deploy`** — deployment & hosting: standalone, sprig-hosted
  (`serveSprig`/`sprigUi`), `withBasePath`, Deno Deploy, the in-process `backend`
  client, logging. Owns `references/deployment.md`.

## Flow

1. **Classify the question by domain** (main session):
   - auth / 401 / 403 / infra bearer / grants / `INFRA_URL` / docs-access → `rune-framework-auth`
   - `bootstrapServer` / `@Endpoint` semantics / `order`·`dependsOn`·`bind` / the
     `exerciseEndpoints`·`/docs/_run`·`/docs/_map` runner surface / WS sockets →
     `rune-framework-runtime`
   - serving / hosting under sprig / `withBasePath` / Deno Deploy / logging →
     `rune-framework-deploy`
2. **Delegate** to that specialist via the Task tool. Pass: the question/symptom
   (with the failing request + origin + any response body), the project root,
   optionally a running server's base URL, and **the absolute path to the
   specialist's reference file** (`claude/skills/rune:framework/references/<auth|endpoints|deployment>.md`,
   or the installed `~/.claude/skills/rune:framework/references/…`). The agent
   reads its own reference; do not paste it into the prompt.
3. **Summarize** the specialist's return (cause + cited rule + evidence + minimal
   fix) for the user. If the answer spans domains (e.g. "my deployed sprig app
   401s" = deploy mount + auth trust), call the second specialist with the first's
   finding as context, then synthesize both.
4. **Route real fixes out**: a spec change → `rune:spec`; a generated-body/test fix
   → `rune:build`; a real-data e2e walk → `rune:cake`; a per-endpoint Swagger
   example → `rune:docs`.

**Cross-cutting note (`#assert` → 422):** the runtime maps a failed `RuneAssertError`
to HTTP 422; `rune-framework-runtime` explains the mapping, but the *authoring* side
(where asserts/`[TYP]` modifiers come from) is **`rune:spec`**.

## Hard rule

The main session delegates to the named specialist; it does not answer the runtime
question itself. Each specialist is read-mostly and owns exactly one reference —
keep their domains distinct so routing stays unambiguous.

## What's no longer here

The per-domain how-to (the trust model, the `@Endpoint`/runner option surface, the
mounting recipes) now lives in the three specialists and their reference files —
this playbook only routes.
